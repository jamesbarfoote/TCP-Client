Questions:
1.  Why will it usually take long time to detect that a socket communication party is
not reachable?


2. . Is it possible to force a socket to empty its data in the buffer? If so, how to do
that?
    No it is not possible to force the buffer to empty. One reason is because of how TCP uses a Window.

3. Explain the concept of out-of-band data in socket communication.


4.  Suppose that you want to deliver a series of messages in order and reliably from
computer A to computer B through the Internet. Discuss how to achieve this goal
through socket programming.

5. Suppose that a socket client running on a SPARC processor is receiving an
integer from a socket server running on an ALPHA processor. Suppose also that the
SPARC processor stores an integer in 32 bits and the ALPHA processor stores an
integer in 64 bits. Can the socket client receive the correct integer from the socket
server? Make sure that you explain your answers.
